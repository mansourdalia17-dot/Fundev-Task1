â€œI designed this website page as a FrontEnd application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It contains four input fields as placeholders, and when the mouse moves over them, an alert box appears.
The page includes options to select a city from a dropdown menu, choose gender using radio elements, and select study levels via checkboxes.
When the save button is clicked, the background color changes from white to orange, and as an additional feature, the button color changes from aquaBlue to red.
